This directory contains some utilities to load the example programs from within
GHCi.

Copy (or symlink) the wrapper script 'ghci' to the root directory of the
accelerate-examples source tree. The script can be called from the root
directory, or from the root of any of the example programs. It will also
attempt to load the CUDA backend from source. You might also like to copy the
file 'dot_ghci' to '.ghci' into the root directory.
